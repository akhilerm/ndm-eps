### Dynamically fetching details of disk by seachest/smart probe

Currently seachest and smart probe can get all the info of disk which has been attached to the host before the Deamonset pod started. But info
of disks which are attached after the pod is started is not available due to a bug in docker, which prevents `/dev` of the container from being updated. New disks/lvms that are made available on the host will not have an entry in the `/dev` directory. This causes seachest and smart probe to fail because they require devpath to fetch the details.

The method I propose to get the device files inside `/dev` is a little bit risky, but can be gauranteed to work. I propose to create a separate script (python/shell) which listens for udev events and whenever finds a device which does  not have an entry in the `/dev` directory, use the syspath obtained from udevadm, and call mknod() to create the device. This script will also create approprate symlinks (by-id, by-path) for the device is `/dev/disk`. This according to me is a very bad approach to solving the problem, because we violate the principle of running a single process in a container.
